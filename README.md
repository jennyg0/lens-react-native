## Problem

You want to stay connected and know what your friends are up to but don't want to give away all your data and the power to choose what content can be shared to a centralized corporation.

## How does it work

Built on Lens, this app uses Livepeer to power video status updates that disappear from the feed after 24 hours. Users can either take a video using their phone camera or upload from the gallery. These videos can be on their profile forever to view and share if they choose, ~for the mems~.

# Future

I would like to add notifications so the app could either prompt you to post at a certain time, similar to BeReal, or so as a user you could send a notification to a group of your followers when you post an update to let them know what you are doing and see if they can join. Messaging would also also be a great add to facilitate more connecting as well.
